This study offers critical automatic workflows to examine the displacement–distance profiles and insert the mechanical stratigraphy.

Abstract 

Displacement distribution and profile patterns are controlled by mechanical stratigraphy on a regional scale. Here, we present a detailed analysis of isolated thrust faults in multilayer stratigraphy and their displacement-distance profiles in coal mines, the lower Rhine basin, Ruhr sub-basin, Germany, where claystone, sandstone with siltstones, coarse sandstone and rhyolite tuff act as mechanically controlling elements of stratigraphy to an array of thrust faults. Faults generally show systematic variations in displacement approaching their tips. These variations can be displayed on displacement–distance diagrams - where offsets between multiple pairs of footwall and hanging-wall cut-offs are cross-plotted against a distance measured along the fault surface from a reference point. Coloured displacement-distance profiles according to the stratigraphic lithology and displacement length can help understand the mechanical controls on displacement distribution along thrust faults. Conducting such studies across interpreted subsurface cross-sections can provide more robust constraints in adequately determining displacement-distance profiles, their patterns and displacement-length relationships. Idealised displacement–distance profiles for single isolated faults show diminishing offsets to fault tip-line. However, our results are more complex, with varying profiles that deviate from the idealised pattern. A constant displacement–distance pattern is common in sandstone layers, while variable displacement–distance patterns are more common in the finer-grained units. Thinly interbedded successions display the most complex displacement–distance relationships. Displacement distance profiles, local gradient, thrust length and maximum displacement are considered against the lithological stratigraphy through which each fault cuts. Analysis of fold-thrust displacement profiles shows that the multilayered stratigraphy influences displacement–distance patterns, presumably because additional strain components are heterogeneously developed in the rock wall. A Python script to automatically plot displacement distance profiles with their associated lithology has been developed to aid the analysis of displacement–distance profiles for faults. As our demand for subsurface use increases for a range of activities, including CO2 storage, nuclear waste disposal and energy storage, the importance of understanding fault displacements in multilayered stratigraphy also increases. The work here is designed to aid data collection and analysis in multilayer stratigraphy.
